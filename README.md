# Employee_Attrition

1. The video is uploaded in the repository also an additional google drive link is given in the "Employee_Attrition" pdf
2. The "Untitled2.ipynb" file contains the dataset analysis and model testing and training code.
3. This file can be simply viewed through the repository itself
4. To access the file and to make changes in it either download the file or clone the repository
5. After cloning the repository the file would be seen in the cloned folder on your local desktop
6. To run the downloaded/ cloned file you can use an IDE like VSCode.
7. Or you can also run the file on jupyter notebook by typing "jupyter notebook" on your terminal and then accessing the folder where the file is kept on jupyter's dashboard
8. So these were the steps how the dataset analyses and model testing and training file can be accessed. ("Untitled2.ipynb")
9. The findings summary pdf is with the name "Employee_Attrition.pdf" it can also be downloaded through the repository itself or if you clone the repository the it will be present in that folder.
